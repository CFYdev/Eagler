# Eagler-Client
Client for Eagler 1.5.2 that I set up for the sole purpose of making Tyler play on my server.

Old link just in case:

Handy dandy screenshot with all of the server links. Only the `us110` servers (now `us114` due to Gitpod's shit) are up (during 3rd and 6th period, but rarely during 5th or possibly even 4th). The `us108` and `us109` servers havent been up since, well, ever.
